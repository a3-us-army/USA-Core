		// *We're a semi-milsim unit primarily focused on special operations and small team tactics. We like to keep things structured, but we always prioritize keeping things fun while being organized. Our missions are designed to challenge teamwork and precision, but we also understand that real life comes first. Attendance isn't strict; however, if our numbers drop too low, weâ€™ll usually reach out to check in with members who are E-3+ and keep everyone in the loop. We are a closely knitted community and we love tactical realism. Our goal is to create an enjoyable and immersive experience for all.*
